1.instal postgresql
2.run postgresql on your terminal and create a database
3. you will need to create two (2) tables
4.the first table: CREATE TABLE users ( id serial PRIMARY KEY, Name VARCHAR(100),Email text UNIQUE NOT NULL, entries BIGINIT DEFAULT 0, joined TIMESTAMP NOT NULL);
5.the second table: CREATE TABLE LOGIN ( id serial PRIMARY KEY, hash VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, Email text UNIQUE NOT NULL);
6.make sure that the first letter to your table colummns is upper case as is written here other wise the server will not recognise it
7.in you server.js file 
const db = knex({
  client: "pg",
  connection: {
 (your localhost)   host: "127.0.0.1",
(your database port(this is deafult postgresql))  port: 5432,
 (your postgresql username)   user: "hassan",
 (your postgresql password)   password: "lamp1388",
 (name of the data base with the two tables)   database: "faceD",
  },
});
once you have written the addres of the database in your server.js file it should work like a charm!
